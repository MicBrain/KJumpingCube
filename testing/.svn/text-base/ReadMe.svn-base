Notes on test-jump61.

The .in files instruct test-jump61b how to perform a test.

* Lines that start with "#" are comments.

* The first two non-comment lines are Unix commands for running an
  instance of the jump61b program.  It's possible to run either one or
  two programs.  To run just one program, use "None" as the second line.

* After the two command lines there are two sections, starting with the
  headers "===#1===" and "===#2===".  The lines in these sections are fed
  as the standard input respectively to two programs (any input in section
  #2 is ignored if the second command is None).

* When there are two programs, they are expected to be playing each other.
  Certain of the lines in the two input sections are interpreted specially
  to accommodate this:

    + %ib  Wait for a blue move from the other program and insert it here.
           (A "blue move" is a line such as "Blue moves 3 2.", as specified
           in the spec).
    + %ir  Wait for a red move from the other program and insert it here.
    + %mb  Wait for this program to print a blue move, and send it to
           the other program.
    + %mr  Wait for this program to print a red move, and send it to
           the other program.
    + %br  Wait for a sequence of alternating blue and red moves from
           this program (playing itself), starting with blue, up to an
           announcement of a winner.
    + %rb  As for %br, but starting with a red move.
    + %ib... As for %ib, and then wait for a red move from this
           program, send it to the other program, and then repeat
           these steps up to an announcement of a winner.
    + %ir... As for %ir, and then wait for a blue move from this
           program, send it to the other program, and then repeat
           these steps up to an announcement of a winner.
    + %e   Indicates a point where test-jump61 expects an announcement
           of a winner (for either side).
    + %eb  As for %e, but expects to see "Blue wins."
    + %er  As for %e, but expects to see "Red wins."
    + %ae  As for %e, but also prints winner.


The .out files tell test-jump61 what the relevant outputs of the two
programs should be.  Under the headings "Program #1:" (and, for two
programs, "Program #2:"), it shows all output from the respective
programs that conforms to the specified format for dumps (surrounded
by "==="), and it shows all lines that match the %ae specifier described
above.  Other output lines are filtered out.  Test-jump61 compares these
.out files with the actual outputs produced by the programs being tested.
