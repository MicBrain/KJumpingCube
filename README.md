### Rules

Here are all the rules of this game:

1. A move consists of clicking on a cube that does not belong to your opponent.
2. The move increases the points in the cube by one.
3. At the start of the game, each cube has one point, is painted in a neutral color and has no owner.
4. Each player has a color to mark the ownership of cubes.
5. By clicking a cube that has no owner, the player becomes the owner of that cube and it changes its color to the player's color. Simultaneously the cubeâ€™s value is increased by one.
6. If a cube has more points than it has neighbors, one point jumps to each of the neighbors.
